# Data-Science-Project


This project has been developed during the discipline Introduction To Data Science.

We use Python with some libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and others.

The main goal of this project is take a dataset and make analyzes such as the dispersion measures and data visualization.

For example, when we talk about dispersion measures we can calculate the mode, median and variance. For data visualization we can plot some graphics as the correlation of some columns, histogram and others.
